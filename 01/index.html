            <h1>Best Shoes</h1>
            <p>Men's shoes are not only a practical addition to an outfit - they are often the finishing touch to a
                given style. We cannot forget about the functionality of footwear, which should provide us with comfort
                and safety at every step. High quality workmanship, comfort of use and unique style are offered by
                branded men's shoes. Buying at least one pair from a well-known and respected brand will be a good
                investment for many years. The most popular shoe brands - what is worth knowing about them? What are the
                must-have shoe brands in your collection? We give you a hint!</p>

                <p>Between my wife and me we probably own 9 or 10 pairs. By far the most comfortable shoes we have. They
                    literally fit like a glove (and are made of leather that actually reminds me of a baseball glove,
                    but softer). And people notice. Not that we care! </p>

                <p>Now having 7pairs of atheists shoes I find I like the boots best. In fact the emerald boot is
                    absolutely terrific, the color is great and it is the softest to touch of all my shoes. Just let me
                    know of any other color boot mayed from the same leather.</p>
